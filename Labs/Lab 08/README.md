# Lab 08 (Node MCU)

The aim of the lab was to test our skills in dealing with a Node MCU. We had to display some information related to the connectivity. Make the node mcu work as a server, accept a clientâ€™s request and generate a response. In the final task, we modified the previous code so that the page displays a drop down list and a button to handle the request of the user of blinking an LED n times.
This lab consists of three LabTasks.

# Lab Tasks

## LabTask1:
In this LabTask, we had to use the ESP8266WiFi library. We connected the Node MCU to a WLAN, display the connectivity information (IP Address, MAC Address, Gateway IP) on the serial monitor.

## LabTask2:
In this LabTask, we make our Node MCU work as a server, made it handle a request from a browser of the client and generate an appropriate response.

## LabTask3:
In this LabTask, we connected an LED with our Node MCU and made it work as a server. Displayed a drop-down list and a submit button for the client to select a number from 1 to 9 which corresponds to the number of times the LED is to be blinked.
